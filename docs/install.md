# install

Installs libdefs into the ./flow-typed directory.

### Examples

```
flow-typed install
flow-typed install webpack // Not specifying version only works when listed in package.json
flow-typed install react-redux@7
flow-typed install axios@0.11.x
flow-typed install --ignoreDeps peer bundle
```

### Ignoring dependencies

Sometimes you will come across dependencies that you both don't use in code and aren't defined in `flow-typed`, `@babel/core` is a good example and you don't want it polluting your codebase or causing unnecessarily large diffs during updates. Alternatively you may have some specific libdef version different to what is referenced in package.json and you don't want that swapped out.

The `.ignore` file which you can place in `./flow-typed` can solve this by referencing scopes or packages you'd like to explicitly exclude when `flow-typed` tries to install/update libdefs for you.

```
# in `./flow-typed/.ignore`
# libraries are excluded on an exact match basis
@babel/
@testing-library/react
eslint
eslint-config-airbnb
```
