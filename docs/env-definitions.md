# Environment Definitions

Flow is a static analysis tool that exposes a range of global definitions (core libs) to help you type your application. But flow only supports for the most part, two types of environments, node and browser. Sometimes you want something a little extra, but it's not the best fit for the flow core libs.

That's where environment definitionsâ„¢ from flow-typed come into play, a home for all those global definitions to share and reuse and standardize for specific environments.

## Usage

If you're on version `>=3.8.0` you can make use of the `env` property in [flow-typed.config.json](flow-typed-config.md).

```json
{
  env: ["jsx", "node", ...],
}
```

A full list of environments can be found in the [definitions](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions/environments) project directory.

## Examples

To make it more concrete, lets take a look at some examples of when you might want to use an environment definition.

### jsx

Flow is built by Meta and ships with `react` library definitions. You'd expect because of that, everything react related would work perfectly and has sound static analysis working out of the box with a react stack. It however does not, you get no type checking or intellisense when using jsx elements nor are there any available list of HTML attributes for each HTML element type.

```js
const Comp = () => (
  <input type="foo" anything={0} />
);
```

Typically you'd expect the above to error in some capacity because `foo` is not a valid `type` and `anything` isn't a prop that `<input />` accepts. But you get nothing and there's currently no way to add type definitions to primitive jsx as a third party tool.

But with environment definitions serving reusable type definitions, at the minimum you can soundly type reusable components across your application.

```js
type Props = {|
  ...$Exact<jsx$HTMLElement>,
  foo: string,
|};

const Input = ({
  foo,
  ...otherProps
}: Props) => {
  return (
    <input {...otherProps} />
  );
};
```

### node

Although flow ships with both node and browser library definitions there is no mode to distinguish between the two. Sometimes this can cause conflict if there are api's that have the same name but drastically different type definitions depending on which environment it's used in. An env definition could solve this as it's loaded after the built-in's and could override functionality of a declared var.

---

These are just a couple examples but env definitions could serve a range of purposes for just about anything that isn't related to npm packages.

The rules of creating an env definition are also quite similar to npm library definitions in that they support flow version ranges but differ in that they do not declare any modules nor have package versions.
