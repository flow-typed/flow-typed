## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.0] - 2018-03-16

### IMPORTANT

A week after this release, all previous versions of `flow-typed` on npm will be DEPRECATED, in order to encourage upgrading to version `2.4.0`. After which, we will be introducing files to definition folders under `/definitions/npm`, which will break the `search`, `install` and `validate-defs` commands.

**We strongly recommend upgrading to `2.4.0` within that timeframe.**

### Added
- Allow any file type (.md, .json) under `/definitions/npm/<library>_vx.x.x/` (#1962)
- `describe` and `it` can now be importing from `'flow-typed-test'` in `_test` files (#1942)
  - See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Root directory option (-rootDir) to install command (#1835)

### Changed
- Replace `unzip` with `unzipper` (#1957)

### Fixed
- Fix jest specs breaking by adding `babel-core` as a dependency (#1864)
