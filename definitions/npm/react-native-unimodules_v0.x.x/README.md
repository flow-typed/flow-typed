This [module](https://unpkg.com/react-native-unimodules@0.3.1/index.js) based on four dependencies:

- [expo-asset](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions/npm/expo-asset_v4.x.x)
- [expo-permissions](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions/npm/expo-permissions_v4.x.x)
- [expo-file-system](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions/npm/expo-file-system_v4.x.x)
- [expo-constants](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions/npm/expo-constants_v4.x.x)

If you want to add changes, you should update separate definitions. After that add changes to this module.
