# Contributing to the Ramda Flow libdef

Hello, We want to make the types for this library even better!
First of all, you shouldn’t be equal to tests that you’d better use recommendations about [writing tests](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#writing-tests).

## How can you help?

- We currently have unclosed [issues](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+ramda) that you can help solve.
- Also, you can implement new features of new [ramda realizes](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/issues?q=label%3A%22upgrade+guide%22)

And finally, if you need feedback to offer you can ask **@LoganBarnett**.
