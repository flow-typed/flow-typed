    This service allows users to send emails with complete control over the
      content of the email. Unlike GmailApp, MailApp's sole purpose is sending email. MailApp cannot
      access a user's Gmail inbox.

    Changes to scripts written using GmailApp are more likely to trigger a re-authorization
      request from a user than MailApp scripts.
