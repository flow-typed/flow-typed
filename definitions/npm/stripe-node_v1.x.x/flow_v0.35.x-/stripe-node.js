     * Updates an existing subscription on a customer to match the specified parameters. When changing plans or quantities,

    By default, we prorate subscription changes. For example, if a customer signs up on May 1 for a $10 plan, she'll be billed
    $10 immediately. If she then switches to a $20 plan on May 15, on June 1 she'll be billed $25 ($20 for a renewal of her
    subscription and a $5 prorating adjustment for the previous month). Similarly, a downgrade will generate a credit to be
    applied to the next invoice. We also prorate when you make quantity changes. Switching plans does not change the billing
    date or generate an immediate charge unless you're switching between different intervals (e.g. monthly to yearly), in which
    case we apply a credit for the time unused on the old plan and charge for the new plan starting right away, resetting the
    billing date. (Note that if we charge for the new plan, and that payment fails, the plan change will not go into effect). If
    you'd like to charge for an upgrade immediately, just pass prorate as true as usual, and then invoice the customer as soon
    as you make the subscription change. That'll collect the proration adjustments into a new invoice, and Stripe will automatically
    attempt to pay the invoice. If you don't want to prorate at all, set the prorate option to false and the customer would be billed
    $10 on May 1 and $20 on June 1. Similarly, if you set prorate to false when switching between different billing intervals
    (monthly to yearly, for example), we won't generate any credits for the old subscription's unused time, although we will still
    reset the billing date and bill immediately for the new subscription.
