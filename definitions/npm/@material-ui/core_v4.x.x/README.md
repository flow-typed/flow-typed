## Additional declared modules

### Common types

- `@material-ui/core/flow-types` - This module include all common types

### Abstraction

- `@material-ui/core/@@dom` - This module contains types for `DOM Elements`.

For example, if you need more strict types for props of `input` based components,
you can describe them in a `HTMLImageAttributes` type and all components inherit your changes.

### Third-party modules

The following modules are used as an abstraction 
to resolve a problem with [dependencies between library definitions](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/issues/1857).

I copied only the necessary parts of the types.

For example, to describe the component `<Box/>` I need several types from `csstype`

- `@material-ui/core/@@csstype` => `csstype`
- `@material-ui/core/@@utils` => `@material-ui/core/utils`
- `@material-ui/core/@@JSS` => `jss`
- `@material-ui/core/@@react-transition-group` => `react-transition-group`

# Known issues

## â„–1 OverridableComponents

I [don't know](https://github.com/facebook/flow/issues/7701) how to infer type dynamically based by `component` prop:

```js
import { Button } from '@material-ui/core';

type MyButtonProps = {
  abcd: string,
};

const MyButton = (props: MyButtonProps) => <i />;

<Button
  component={MyButton}
  abcd={1} // need error
/>;
```
