_**Notice:** The current [`flow-typed` npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/flow-typed) is not up-to-date, nor is it particularly useful. `flow-typed` 2.0.0 is underway and will be published to npm when it's ready._

`flow-typed` is a repository of third-party 
[library interface definitions](http://flowtype.org/docs/third-party.html) 
for use with [Flow](http://flowtype.org/).

## Huh?

When you start a project with Flow, **you might want to use some third-party 
libraries that were *not* written with Flow**. Flow is usually able to work it's 
way around this, but at the unfortunate cost of typing those third-party modules 
as `any`. As a result, Flow can't give errors if you accidentally mis-use the 
library (nor will it be able to auto-complete the library).

To address this, **Flow supports 
[library definitions](http://flowtype.org/docs/third-party.html)** which allow 
you to describe the interface of a module or library separate from the 
implementation of that module/library. 

**The `flow-typed` repo is a collection of high-quality library definitions**, 
tests to ensure that they remain high quality, and tooling to make it as easy as 
possible to import them into your project.

## How Do I Contribute?

Just send a pull request!

All definitions sit under the 
[/definitions](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions) 
folder. They all must follow the following naming format:

`<NPM_PACKAGE_NAME>_v<VERSION>`/`flow_v<VERSION>`/`<NPM_PACKAGE>_v<VERSION>.js`

Where `<VERSION>` is a semver version number with all of MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH
version numbers included. `x` is an acceptable wildcard in place of any of the 
three version numbers, and it is also acceptable to put `>=` or `<=` in front of
the `v` to indicate a range of versions.

Example filename:

`underscore_v1.x.x/flow_>=v0.13.x/underscore_v1.x.x.js`

This is a library definition for all "1.x.x" versions of underscore that works
with any version of Flow >= v0.13.

**We structure files this way is to enable automated testing and tooling.**
Tests ensure that library definitions continue to work as expected and the
`flow-typed` tooling ensures that it's as easy as possible to find and install 
library definitions.

#### Writing Tests

**When you contribute a new library definition (or make a change to an existing 
one), you should include tests with your change.**

Tests are simply `test-*.js` files that sit next to the library definition 
file. Their purpose is to exercise the defined library and ultimately produce
zero Flow errors for each version of Flow that the libdef is specified as 
compatible with.

**Often it is useful to test that a particular usage of a library definition 
*does* produce an error.** For this you can write some code that produces a Flow 
error and just put `// $ExpectError` on the line above where the error is 
produced. This will tell the test runner that an error is intentional and 
expected on the following line.

## `flow-typed` CLI

The `flow-typed` npm package provides a CLI that provides several commands for
working with this repository:

##### `flow-typed validate-defs`

Verifies that all files under the `/definitions/` directory are structured 
properly. **It does not run tests**, it only asserts that file and directory 
names match the expected conventions.

##### `flow-typed run-tests [optional-pattern]`

Runs *all* compatible versions of Flow over the each library definition with 
it's tests to ensure that the tests pass as expected.

Note that this command assumes that the `/definitions/` directory is correctly 
structured. You can always verify the structure with the 
[`flow-typed validate-defs`](#flow-typed-validate-defs) command.

##### *(...coming soon...)* `flow-typed libdefs-for-pkg /path/to/package.json`

Scans the specified `package.json`, looks for any compatible libdefs in the 
`flow-typed` github repo, and prints a JSON list of URLs for each that is found.
