`flow-typed` is a [repository](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions) of third-party 
[library interface definitions](http://flowtype.org/docs/third-party.html) 
for use with [Flow](http://flowtype.org/).

You can grab definitions directly from this GitHub repo, or you can use the CLI (currently in beta) to install a libdef for a given library:
```bash
$ npm install -g flow-typed

$ cd /path/to/my/project
$ npm install
$ flow-typed install
'rxjs_v5.0.x.js' installed at /path/to/my/project/flow-typed/npm/rxjs_v5.0.xjs
```

## Huh?

When you start a project with Flow, **you likely want to use some third-party 
libraries that were *not* written with Flow**. By default, Flow will just ignore
these libraries **leaving them untyped**. As a result, Flow can't give errors if 
you accidentally mis-use the library (nor will it be able to auto-complete the 
library).

To address this, **Flow supports 
[library definitions](http://flowtype.org/docs/third-party.html)** which allow 
you to describe the interface of a module or library separate from the 
implementation of that module/library. 

**The `flow-typed` repo is a collection of high-quality library definitions**, 
tests to ensure that definitions remain high quality, and tooling to make it 
as easy as possible to import them into your project. 

All you have to do when you add a one or more new dependencies to your project 
is run `flow-typed install`. This will search the libdef repo and download all
the libdefs that are relevant for your project and install them for you. After
that, **simply check them in** and be on your way!

## Why do I need to commit the libdefs that `flow-typed` installs for my project?

Libdefs in flow-typed are tagged at both Flow and library version when they are
installed, but libdefs themselves can improve over time. For example, they may
have a bug or there may be an improvement to their accuracy or completeness.

When a libdef is improved or updated in flow-*typed*, there's some chance that
the change could introduce new Flow errors into your project. As good as it is
to find new issues, **we also want to make sure that Flow-errors in your project
are consistent and predictable over time**.

So if/when you wish to upgrade a libdef that you've already checked in to your
project's version control, you can do so explicitly with the 
`flow-typed install --overwrite` command.

## How Do I Contribute Library Definitions?

Just send a pull request!

All definitions sit under the 
[/definitions](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions) 
directory. They all must follow the following directory structure and naming 
format:

```
└ definitions/npm/
  ├ yargs_v4.x.x/           # <-- The name of the library, followed by _v<VERSION>
  | |
  | ├ flow_v0.23.x/         # <-- A folder containing libdefs tested against the 
  | | |                     #     specified version(s) of Flow (v0.23.x in this
  | | |                     #     case).
  | | |
  | | └ yargs_v4.x.x.js     # <-- The libdef file meant for the Flow version 
  | |                       #     specified by the containing directory's name. 
  | |                       #     Must be named `<LIB>_v<VERSION>.js`.
  | |
  | ├ flow_v0.19.x-v0.22.x/ # <-- A folder containing libdefs tested against a 
  | | |                     #     different range of Flow versions: 
  | | |                     #     Anything from v0.19.x to v0.22.x (inclusive)
  | | |
  | | ├ yargs_v4.x.x.js     # <-- The libdef file for versions of Flow from 
  | | |                     #     v0.19.x to v0.22.x (inclusive)
  | | |
  | | └ test_yargs.js       # <-- Tests in this directory only apply to the 
  | |                       #     adjacent libdef (and thus, are specific to
  | |                       #     the libdefs for this specific Flow version) 
  | |
  | └ test_yargs.js         # <-- Tests in this directory apply to libdefs for
  |                         #     all versions of Flow. 
  ├ color_v0.7.x/
  ├ ...
```

Versions are semver versions with some restrictions:

* All of MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH versions must be specified. It's acceptable to
  specify `x` in place of a number for MINOR and PATCH, but MAJOR cannot be `x`.
* Library versions may not specify a semver range, but Flow versions can of the 
  following forms: 
  * **`flow_v0.22.x-`**: Flow v0.22.x and above
  * **`flow_v0.22.x-v0.28.x`**: Flow versions v0.22.x up to v0.28.x (inclusive)
  * **`flow_-v0.22.x`**: Every version under (and including) Flow v0.22.x

**We structure files this way to enable automated testing and tooling.**
Tests ensure that library definitions continue to work as expected and the
`flow-typed` tooling ensures that it's as easy as possible to find and install 
library definitions.

#### Writing LibDef Tests

**When you contribute a new library definition (or make a change to an existing 
one), you must include tests with your change.**

Tests are simply `test_*.js` files that sit next to the library definition 
file. They are normal @flow-ified .js files that import from and use the types
declared in the libdef in a way they are expected to be used. Flow-typed CI will
then run all applicable versions of Flow against the test file to be sure that
only *expected* errors occur.

In order to write code where you expect an error, you can put `// $ExpectError`
on the line above one of the lines listed in the error. This tells the test 
runner to ignore errors that mention that line. **We require at least 1
// $ExpectError in each test**. This helps to ensure that the test is actually
exercising types like the author expects it to be.

## FAQs

### When I install the `flow-typed` CLI, I get an error that mentions `OpenSSL or Libgcrypt` 

You may need to install Libgcrypt. Try setting up 
[homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html) and running `brew install libgcrypt`.

This issue was first reported here: 
[#336](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/issues/336)

### When I install the `flow-typed` CLI, I get an error immediately after `[configuring libssh2]`

You may need to install OpenSSL. Try setting up 
[homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html) and running `brew install openssl`.

This issue was first reported here:
[331](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-typed/issues/331)

## `flow-typed` CLI

The `flow-typed` npm package provides a CLI that provides several commands for
working with this repository:

##### `flow-typed validate-defs`

Verifies that all files under the `/definitions/` directory are structured and 
named properly. **It does not run tests**, it only asserts that file and 
directory names match the expected conventions.

This command is run during CI.

##### `flow-typed run-tests [optional-pattern]`

For each libdef, find each test and run it with all compatible versions of Flow.
If any errors arise that are not *`// $ExpectError`*, the test has failed.

Note that this command assumes that the `/definitions/` directory is correctly 
structured. It should be run *after* running 
[`flow-typed validate-defs`](#flow-typed-validate-defs).

##### `flow-typed update-cache [--debug]`

By default flow-typed retrieves all available libdefs from its related upstream
repository. To make this process more efficient, those libdefs are cached once 
on your local filesystem. Usually, the cache will automatically be updated after
a short grace period during a libdef installation, but sometimes it is useful to
do this update manually. Use this command if you want to download the most
recent definitions into the cache for yourself.

The debug flag will output additional (error) information, which can be useful for
bug-reports.
