`flow-typed` is a [repository](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/tree/master/definitions) of third-party
[library interface definitions](https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs)
for use with [Flow](http://flow.org).

You can grab definitions directly from this GitHub repo, or you can use the CLI (currently in beta) to install a libdef for a given library:
```bash
$ yarn global add flow-typed

$ cd /path/to/my/project
$ yarn install
$ flow-typed install rxjs@5.0.x
'rxjs_v5.0.x.js' installed at /path/to/my/project/flow-typed/npm/rxjs_v5.0.xjs
```

## Huh?

When you start a project with Flow, **you likely want to use some third-party
libraries that were *not* written with Flow**. By default, Flow will just ignore
these libraries **leaving them untyped**. As a result, Flow can't give errors if
you accidentally mis-use the library (nor will it be able to auto-complete the
library).

To address this, **Flow supports
[library definitions](https://flow.org/en/docs/libdefs)** which allow
you to describe the interface of a module or library separate from the
implementation of that module/library.

**The `flow-typed` repo is a collection of high-quality library definitions**,
tests to ensure that definitions remain high quality, and tooling to make it
as easy as possible to import them into your project.

All you have to do when you add one or more new dependencies to your project
is run `flow-typed install`. This will search the libdef repo and download all
the libdefs that are relevant for your project and install them for you. After
that, **simply check them in** and be on your way!

## Getting Started

Check out [Importing And Using Type Definitions](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/wiki/Importing-And-Using-Type-Definitions)
in the wiki. It will walk you through using typedefs installed through flow-typed,
as well as writing and including your own.

## FAQs

## How Do I Contribute Library Definitions?

Just send a pull request! The wiki on
[Contributing Library Definitions](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/wiki/Contributing-Library-Definitions)
details the format of new contributions. Contributions should follow the best practices outline on
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

#### Contributing to the CLI

Bugfixes and improvements to the core CLI are welcome. If you'd like to contribute
a new feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it.

## `flow-typed` CLI

The `flow-typed` npm package provides a CLI that includes several commands for
working with this repository. The full list of commands is available at
[CLI Commands & Flags](https://github.com/flow-typed/flow-typed/wiki/CLI-Commands-and-Flags).

##### `flow-typed install [package-specification] [--ignoreDeps deps]`

Installs libdefs from looking at your package.json.

If `package-specification` was specified, only that one libdef will be installed.
If the `--ignoreDeps` flag was specified, the libdefs for the specified deps will be ignored. i.e: `--ignoreDeps dev bundle peer`.

```bash
flow-typed install foo@1.2.3
```

##### `flow-typed validate-defs`

Verifies that all files under the `/definitions/` directory are structured and
named properly. **It does not run tests**, it only asserts that file and
directory names match the expected conventions.

This command is run during CI.

##### `flow-typed run-tests [optional-pattern]`

For each libdef, find each test and run it with all compatible versions of Flow.
If any errors arise that are not *`// $ExpectError`*, the test has failed.

Note that this command assumes that the `/definitions/` directory is correctly
structured. It should be run *after* running `flow-typed validate-defs`.

##### `flow-typed update-cache [--debug]`

By default flow-typed retrieves all available libdefs from its related upstream
repository. To make this process more efficient, those libdefs are cached once
on your local filesystem. Usually, the cache will automatically be updated after
a short grace period during a libdef installation, but sometimes it is useful to
do this update manually. Use this command if you want to download the most
recent definitions into the cache for yourself.
